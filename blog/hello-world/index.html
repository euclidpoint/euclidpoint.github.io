The name <em>Euclid Point</em> is a tribute to Euclid of Alexandria, the
famous Greek mathematician who lived around 300 BCE. Not much is known
about Euclid's life but during his lifetime, Euclid compiled ideas in
geometry and number theory known to Greek mathematicians at that time
into a mathematical treatise consisting of 13 books known as the
<em>Elements</em>. It contains a collection of definitions, postulates,
propositions, and mathematical proofs. The name <em>Euclid Point</em> is
a tribute to the <em>Elements</em> too. This classic treatise in
geometry and number theory begins with this simple and profound
statement:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A <em>point</em> is that which has no part.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 2em">
&mdash; Euclid's Elements, Book 1, Definition 1
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The <em>Elements</em> is considered a masterpiece in the application of
logic to mathematics. Euclid's axiomatic approach has had enormous
influential in many areas of science, technology, and mathematics over
the centuries that have passed sinced then. Euclid's algorithm to find
the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers is the oldest
nontrivial algorithm that has survived to the present day. Euclid's
theorem that asserts the infinitude of prime numbers is fundamental to
number theory. Therefore, it seemed apt to name this community after the
work of a mathematician that has been integral in the development of
science and technology in this world.

<p>
In this community, we have the following goals in mind:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Be a platform where students and professionals of all backgrounds
    can come together to learn and discuss mathematics and computer
    science.
  </li>
  <li>
    Welcome discussion on related areas such as algorithms,
    cryptography, physics, etc. as well as related software tools such
    as \( \LaTeX, \) NumPy, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Discuss mathematical puzzles for fun!
  </li>
</ol>
